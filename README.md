You will find inside a breakdown of how we organized, created, and designed each feature on our retail portal.

## Installation
Use the package manager npm to install all necessary dev dependencies for our repo – run the following terminal command: `npm install`
To make development easier we’ve added nodemon as an npm start script. To automatically restart the node application when file changes in the directory are detected, run the following terminal command:`npm run react-dev`.

## API Configuration
Update `config.example.js` to be `config.js` and add your API Key to `module.exports`.

## ES2015+ support
Spectator supports ES2015+ by transpiling files withBabel. Any JavaScript feature included in thelatest presetcan be used in this repo. The tradeoff for this support is that error messages can sometimes be a bit more obscure and/or line numbers in the stack trace don't map precisely to their original line numbers.If this is not an acceptable tradeoff, you can write only ES5 code create a`spectator.json`file in the root of the problem directory that looks like this:
```
{
  "babel": false
}
```

## Testing
To run the testing files, run the following terminal command:`npm run test`
